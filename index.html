<p>Hi, I'm Sebastian. I'm a medical student with a passion for new technologies and their applications to healthcare systems. Having grown up in a variety of cultures, I've always brought with me a unique perspective and way of perceiving the world. Similarly, my disparate backgrounds in medicine, scientific research, and data science and engineering have shaped my approach toward solving complex problems which span multiple domains in patient-centered healthcare and equitable access to care.</p>
<p>I received my B.A. from <strong>Amherst College</strong> and anticipate graduating in 2021 with an M.D. from <strong>Boston University</strong>. I've also conducted research at a variety of institutions, including <strong>Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital</strong> in Boston, MA; <strong>University of California, San Diego</strong>; and <strong>University of Valencia</strong> in Spain.</p><p>Currently, I'm working on two research projects at my home institution involving the use of machine learning techniques to improve patient care in surgical hernia repair and breast cancer screening. As a self-taught web developer, I have also designed, developed, and contributed to various software projects.</p>
<p>My hobbies include writing, making music, and photography. Some of my artwork has been exhibited at galleries in the Amherst, MA area, and can be viewed under the photography section.</p>
