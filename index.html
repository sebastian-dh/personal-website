<p>Hi, I'm Sebastian. I'm a physician with a passion for new technologies and their applications to healthcare systems. Growing up in multiple cultures and continents, I have called Buenos Aires and New York City my home, among others. To each new place I've brought with me a unique perspective and way of perceiving the world. Similarly, my disparate backgrounds in medicine, scientific research, and data science and engineering have shaped my approach toward solving complex problems which span multiple domains in patient-centered healthcare and equitable access to care.</p>
<p>I received my B.A. from <strong>Amherst College</strong> and M.D. from <strong>Boston University</strong>. I've also conducted research at a variety of institutions, including Brigham and Women's Hospital, an affiliate of <strong>Harvard Medical School</strong>; the <strong>University of California, San Diego</strong>; and the <strong>University of Valencia</strong> in Spain.</p><p>Currently, I'm working on two research projects at my home institution involving the use of machine learning techniques to improve patient care in surgical hernia repair and breast cancer screening. As a self-taught web developer, I have also designed, developed, and contributed to various software projects.</p>
<p>My hobbies include writing, making music, and photography. My artwork has been exhibited at galleries in the Amherst, MA area, some of which can be viewed under the photography section.</p>
