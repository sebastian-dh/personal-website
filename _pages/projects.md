Sensive is a asset collaboration platform for creative professionals. As an intern there, I became familiar with their infrastructure and helped create a CI/CD pipeline using CircleCI. I also built an on-demand image processing server using AWS.

### Convos Community

Convos is a novel, exploratory approach to internet-based communication. This project took two shapes. This first shape, Community, is a platform in which participants share links or posts anonymously and can vote or comment on other posts. This project was built in Ruby.

### Convos Chat

The second shape that Convos took is Chat. In this iteration, participants can have multiple concurrent conversations with each other based on topics and subjects, leading to a more structured, elevated discussion. I used React and Firebase for this project.
